# FreeBSD Continuous Integration Salt Automation

This repository contains salt configuration for managing the CI cluster.

## Installation

See: <http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/freebsd.html>

* pkg install -y sysutils/py-salt #on master and all minions
* Use config files (master, master.d/, minion) from this repository #not samples
* In the minion file, make sure master: is defined and refers to the
  DNS name of the master node.  If this is not defined, each minion will try to connect
  to a master with DNS name "salt".
* Start salt_master service and salt_minion services
* Use salt-key (-L: list, -A: Accept all) node memberships if appropriate
* Test with: salt '*' test.ping

## Usage

Report OS version

```console
% salt '*' grains.item os osrelease osarch
```

Audit packages

```console
% salt '*' pkg.audit
```

Install a package on jenkins node group

```console
# salt -N jenkins pkg.install sudo
```

Run pkg upgrade, on bhyve VMs

```console

Launch a background freebsd-update job. We use cron as fetch does not allow
non-interactive use. Here is how to interrogate background jobs

```console
# salt --async 'jenkins-10.*' cmd.run "freebsd-update cron install"
Executed command with job ID: 20150108050304504294
# salt-run jobs.active
# salt-run jobs.list_job 20150108050304504294
```
